//! Vertical lighting isolation: acceptance cases.
//!
//! Floors and ceilings are solid boundaries for light. The bake models every
//! room floor as a stair-step of zero-thickness interfaces at their own heights
//! and every ceiling as a body above the ceiling plane, so a fixture cannot
//! light through a solid slab while a raised platform, a lowered basin and an
//! intentional vertical opening all keep working. These tests pin that
//! contract:
//!
//! 1. a sealed room above an unlit room stays dark when only the lower room is
//!    lit, and the reverse holds too;
//! 2. colour does not contaminate through a floor slab;
//! 3. an intentional vertical opening (a tall space with an upper floor that
//!    covers only part of it) transmits light through the open side;
//! 4. a partial horizontal overlap is occluded exactly where the upper floor
//!    actually is;
//! 5. a lowered basin or raised platform inside one volume is not treated as a
//!    sealed floor;
//! 6. different ceiling heights create neither leaks nor accidental isolation.
