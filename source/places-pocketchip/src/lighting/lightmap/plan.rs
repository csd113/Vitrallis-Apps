//! The per-level lightmap plan built while the static mesh is emitted.
//!
//! The mesh emitter stamps every lightmapped quad as it writes its six vertices:
//!
//! ```text
//! add_quad(scratch, p0, p1, p2, p3)          // the historical emit call
//!     LIGHTMAPS: LightmapPatch::from_quad(p0, p1, p2, p3)   (u = p0->p1, v = p0->p3)
//!                SkylineAllocator::allocate(patch) -> Chart
//!                Vertex::lightmap = Chart::uv_at(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)
//!                Vertex::lightmap_page = chart.page
//! ```
//!
//! **Orientation is frozen here:** a quad's own winding defines its texture frame
//! — `u` runs `p0 -> p1` and `v` runs `p0 -> p3`, in the exact order the quad's
//! six vertices were passed to [`crate::render::Vertex`]'s emit path. The fill
//! pass reads exactly the same frame through [`LightmapPatch::point_at`]. Nothing
//! may rotate, mirror or rescale a patch relative to its quad; a floor whose
//! quad winds `(x0,z0) -> (x1,z0) -> ...` therefore gets a texel grid aligned
//! with the world, not a rotated one.
//!
//! Chart allocation is inline (one forward pass, first fit, pages in emission
//! order) rather than deferred, because the vertices need their final UVs as
//! they are written and a deferred pass would have to find them again after
//! spatial bucketing and index sharing. Determinism comes from the emitter's
//! fixed order plus the skyline allocator's placement order: the same level
//! always produces the same charts and the same pages.
