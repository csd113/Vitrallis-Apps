"""Office surface artwork: wallpaper, carpet and panel ceiling PNGs.

The three surface families and their two wear states each have one painter;
``ART`` maps the logical texture id to its catalog
``model`` path and painter, which ``build.py`` merges into the manifest.

The PNGs are the authoritative runtime assets: the game loads them at level
load and never runs this script.  Editing this file only matters when the
shipped artwork is meant to change; hand-painted replacements are equally
valid.  The shipped Office sheets are the 1024x1024 artwork, while
this painter generates 128x128 sheets: ``build.py`` skips a shipped sheet
whose dimensions differ from its painter's unless ``--force`` is passed.

Painting rules for this set:

* 128x128, 8-bit RGBA, opaque, tileable in both directions (every pattern
  period divides the sheet and every noise helper wraps);
* pale, near-neutral albedo, because the material ``tint`` and the baked
  lighting multiply into the sampled texel;
* no metre checker and no debug grid: the carpet is mottled pile with a fine
  directional fibre, not four tinted quadrants;
* everything deterministic -- only :mod:`artkit` helpers, no randomness, no
  clock, no external images.
