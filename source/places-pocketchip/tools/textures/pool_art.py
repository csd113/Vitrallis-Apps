"""Pool surface artwork: deck tile, wall tile, basin tile and ceiling PNGs.

The Pool set is deliberately clean, pale and
institutional: commercial tile with restrained grout, a sterile ceiling, and a
basin tile that reads at gameplay distance without turning into a grid.

``ART`` maps each logical texture id to its catalog ``model`` path and painter;
``build.py`` merges it into the manifest.  The PNGs are the authoritative
runtime assets -- the game never runs this script, and the artwork can be
replaced by hand.  The shipped Pool sheets are the 1024x1024
artwork, while this painter generates 128x128 sheets: ``build.py`` skips a
shipped sheet whose dimensions differ from its painter's unless ``--force``
is passed.

Painting rules for this set:

* 128x128, 8-bit RGBA, opaque, tileable in both directions (every pattern
  period divides the sheet and every noise helper wraps);
* pale, near-neutral albedo with a faint cool/green cast, because the baked
  lighting multiplies into the sampled texel;
* the grout line is one pixel and barely darker than the tile -- a joint, not
  a debug grid -- with the per-tile tone jitter and the low-frequency field
  carrying the repetition instead of the grid;
* everything deterministic -- only :mod:`artkit` helpers, no randomness, no
  clock, no external images.
