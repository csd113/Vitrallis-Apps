# Compiled-build, cleanup and QA validation

How the compiled build, cleanup work and QA were verified. Everything here was run on the
development machine (macOS, 960x544 drawable) with the shipped assets and
Places Demo; all scratch output lives under `target/agent-work/`.

## Compiled build and first run

`tests/test_compiled_build.py` runs the actual release executable, copied into a
scratch directory, from a working directory outside the repository. It asserts:

* a portable package (executable + `assets/`) boots from an unrelated working
  directory, resolves its payload from its own path and writes its state next to
  the payload, not in the working directory;
* an empty first-run install creates `levels/`, `import/`, `cache/` and a default
  `settings.json`, and boots the embedded Places Demo with no asset tree at all;
* a restart loads the saved configuration (a hand-edited FOV/filtering survives);
* a malformed `settings.json` is preserved as `settings.json.invalid`, defaults
  are used and a clean file is written;
* malformed custom levels are skipped with the file name and reason;
* unknown materials, props, fixtures and glass degrade with diagnostics and the
  level still renders;
* Places Demo always loads by id;
* normal runs print no developer telemetry.

Run it with:

```sh
cargo build --release
python3 -m unittest tests.test_compiled_build -v
```

## Performance

Same machine, same level, assets and camera (`places_demo`, camera `74,0`,
120 frames after 20 warm-up, `LIMINAL_VSYNC=off`, `LIMINAL_BENCH_FINISH=1`,
7 repeats). `baseline` is commit `60c86f7` (the previous build) built in a worktree and
run with the same content:

| Run | `render_mean_ms` min / median | `loop_median_ms` | draws | binds | material changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseline` Full | 0.963 / 1.009 | 1.108 | 77 | 97 | 77 |
| `full` (this build) | 0.958 / 1.024 | 1.111 | 77 | 97 | 77 |
| `baseline` Low | 0.438 / 0.448 | 0.563 | 77 | 48 | 38 |
| `low` (this build) | 0.442 / 0.450 | 0.531 | 77 | 48 | 38 |

Reading the numbers:

* **No material regression.** Full render min is 0.5 % faster and median 1.5 %
  slower than the previous build, both inside the run-to-run spread; Low is
  flat. Draw calls, texture binds and material changes are identical.
* **Vertex memory +88 vertices** (12 114 → 12 202, +0.7 %): the second pool
  notice board's bottom rail is now visible above the deck instead of buried
  below it. It is the only content change to the demo.
* The numbers were taken before the small startup fix below; the fix does not
  touch the frame path.

### Level build and cache

`LIMINAL_VERBOSE=1` on the same level:

| Path | Level build | Lightmap fill | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cold (no cache) | 191.9 ms | 173.9 ms | bakes 1 page / 350 charts |
| warm (cache hit) | 9–18 ms | 0.0 ms | 2.4 ms probe bake, ~7 ms prop decode |

`LIMINAL_LEVEL=<the level already loaded>` no longer rebuilds it: the game used
to run the whole cold level build twice at startup in that case (once for the
default level, once for the request). A cold verbose run now prints exactly one
`[level]`/`[lightmaps]` build.

Memory at 960x544 Full, from the same telemetry: lightmap atlas 3 072 KiB
(1 048 576 page texels), prop textures 752 KiB for 14 models (2 724 triangles),
plus the post-processing/reflection targets documented in
`post-processing-reflections-validation.md`.

## Places Demo QA

A full capture playthrough (20 views: reception, workroom, stair hall top and
mid, pool entry/wide/basin/steps/deep corner, corridor entry/mid/end, final
doorway, unmade world and back, ceiling, floor-elevation overview) in Full and
Low, each image inspected at full size:

* no Z-fighting, geometry holes, exposed interiors, incorrect materials,
  floating props, broken shadow shapes, light leaks, lightmap seams, broken
  transparency, reflection artifacts or clipping was found;
* the intentional items (the unmade world's missing side walls beyond the final
  doorway, the red stair-hall lighting on the stained wallpaper, the wet deck's
  planar reflection, the backlit signs) were confirmed against the level file;
* **one fix**: the second pool notice board's bottom rail was authored at
  `y = -1.66`, entirely below the deck at `y = -1.5`, so the "four-rail frame"
  had three visible rails. It now sits at `y = -1.49`, offset in `z` so no
  architecture faces are coplanar; the shipped-demo surface audit
  (`the_shipped_demo_has_no_coincident_architecture_surfaces`,
  `places_demo_doorway_thresholds_are_owned_once`) still passes.

The capture poses themselves had a bug on the first pass: `LIMINAL_CAMERA` yaw
is absolute and replaces the spawn yaw, so corridor views aimed sideways and
four frames rendered only background. The committed `capture_views.sh` view
table now carries the correct absolute yaw for every walkthrough view.

## Error paths

Beyond the compiled-build cases above, the Rust suites cover the malformed
content paths, and the error-path coverage added here includes:

* a ZIP entry that lies about its decompressed size cannot expand past the
  per-entry cap (`test_zip_reads_are_capped_by_output_not_the_declared_size`);
* a GLB accessor with `byteStride: 0` and a large `count` is rejected
  (`rejects_zero_stride_accessors_that_claim_many_elements`) and an oversized
  count is refused before allocation
  (`rejects_a_count_larger_than_the_buffer_can_hold`);
* too many floor patches and too many per-wall openings are named loader
  rejections;
* a malformed settings file is preserved and recovered, reserved/duplicate
  bindings are repaired, and action labels are player-facing.

## Validation commands

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features
python3 tools/assets/validate.py
python3 tools/textures/build.py --check
python3 tools/props/build.py --check
python3 -m unittest tests.test_compiled_build
```

The per-change capture scripts and the PocketCHIP device suite were removed; the
historical measurements remain in the other notes in this directory.
