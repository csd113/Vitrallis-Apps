//! Lighting-isolation regression cases.
//!
//! These tests are the acceptance suite for the wall-boundary repair: they use
//! the dedicated regression fixture `tests/fixtures/levels/lighting_isolation.json`,
//! whose thirteen plain cells each isolate one behaviour, and assert the rules
//! the baked lighting model must obey:
//!
//! ```text
//! opaque wall      blocks a direct fixture pool
//! opaque wall      blocks colour, not merely brightness
//! opaque wall      blocks darkness as well: a dark neighbour stays dark
//! doorway          transmits light through the hole it cuts
//! window           transmits light only over its sill and under its header
//! interior stub    blocks a pool inside one room
//! corner           has no artificial brightness collapse
//! ambient          a lightless room stays at the ambient floor
//! several lights   are evaluated one by one; a blocked light is not a veto
//! ```
//!
//! The level is a regression fixture, not packaged content; the file, not this
//! module, owns the layout.

// Test code: unwrap/expect, indexing, loose casts and permissive arithmetic are idiomatic in tests;
// the production lints stay enforced everywhere else in the crate.
