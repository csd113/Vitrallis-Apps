//! Full and Low runtime quality profiles.
//!
//! Places deliberately has exactly two quality modes — there are no
//! hardware-specific tiers, no auto-detection and no per-setting zoo. A profile
//! answers one question: **how much texture data may reach the GPU?**
//!
//! ```text
//! source PNG (asset)  ──decode──▶  Full runtime image  ──upload──▶  GPU
//!                     ──decode──▶  Low runtime image (more aggressively scaled)
//! ```
//!
//! Both profiles use the same levels and the same source assets. Low is not a
//! second art library: it is the same PNG, downscaled further, so the visual
//! identity (and every id, material and fixture) stays identical.
//!
//! Full uploads the native artwork unchanged — a 256x256 prop atlas stays
//! 256x256, and a 1024x1024 surface sheet stays 1024x1024. Low is an optional
//! display-budget reduction for players who want it: sheets at 256 and prop
//! sheets at 128, which is a 16x reduction in texel count for a sheet and a 4x
//! reduction for a prop. It is an intentional quality/performance trade, not a
//! hardware requirement of the desktop target, and it never changes the size
//! of the asset stored in the repository.
//!
//! Texture discipline is unchanged: the decoder still refuses anything above
//! [`crate::assets::MAX_TEXTURE_DIMENSION`], and the shipped prop art budget
//! still caps a prop atlas at its 256x256 native size. A quality profile only
//! decides how much of an *accepted* source reaches the GPU; it never raises
//! the source limit.
//!
//! The same profile also budgets the static lightmap atlas and the baked
//! shadow quality: `Full` bakes at 16 texels per metre onto up to two
//! 1024-texel pages with a nine-tap penumbra, `Low` at 9 texels per metre onto
//! two 512-texel pages with a five-tap one (see [`QualityProfile::lightmap_config`]
//! and [`QualityProfile::shadow_taps_per_axis`]). Both profiles bake from the
//! *same* patch set — density, page size and tap count are the differences,
//! never a different set of surfaces — and both use the same shared chart-span
//! cap, so the geometry splits in the same places.
//!
//! Downscaling happens once, at upload/level-load time, through
//! [`crate::materials::RawImage::downscaled_to`] and is cached with the texture
//! it produced — never per frame, and never twice for the same image. A
//! lightmap atlas is likewise baked once per level load and cached by content
//! key; nothing here runs per frame.
