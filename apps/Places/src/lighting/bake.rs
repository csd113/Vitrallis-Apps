//! The static bake and the queries it answers.
//!
//! [`LevelLighting::bake`] turns a level definition into room baselines, the
//! spatially varying baseline field that lets an internal partition isolate a
//! room's areas, one local pool per fixture, the bounded doorway blends between
//! areas, and the static geometry-visibility set that keeps a fixture from
//! lighting what it cannot see. Everything in this module runs once per level
//! load; the render loop only reads the vertex colours that were baked from it.
//!
//! Baseline field
//! --------------
//! A room whose footprint has no internal partition keeps the historical
//! single [`RoomLighting::baseline`]. A room whose footprint *is* split by
//! opaque walls into disconnected areas gets one baseline per connected area:
//! each area's fixture power is spread over that area's own floor area, so a
//! fixture cannot lend baseline brightness to a part of the room it cannot
//! reach. Connectivity is decided by the same wall-solid geometry the pools
//! use, probed just below the ceiling, so a full-height partition separates,
//! a door's header separates (the doorway blend still transmits locally), and
//! a wall that stops short of the ceiling does not. The two areas are still one
//! room for every other purpose: openings blend their baselines, the summary
//! reports one room, and surfaces keep sampling through the room they belong to.
