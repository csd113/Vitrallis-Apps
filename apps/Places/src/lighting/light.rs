//! Engine-level light sources.
//!
//! A [`LightSource`] is what the lighting system consumes: a shape, a position,
//! a colour, an intensity and a falloff. It owns **no geometry**. A visible
//! object — a ceiling panel, a vending machine, an EXIT sign, a future arcade
//! cabinet — is a separate concern that may *own* zero or more light sources:
//!
//! ```text
//!     visible fixture / prop  ──owns──▶  0..n LightSource
//!            │
//!            └─ material emission: how bright the object itself reads
//! ```
//!
//! That separation is the whole point of this module:
//!
//! * Adding a new glowing object never means adding a new hardcoded light
//!   family. A new fixture *look* is geometry and art; the light it casts is a
//!   shape plus numbers.
//! * Emission and illumination are independent. A surface can emit strongly and
//!   cast nothing, or cast light while emitting little or nothing.
//! * The bake ([`super::bake`]) and everything after it — including a future
//!   lightmap pass — consume this representation rather than fixture ids.
//!
//! Shapes
//! ------
//! The compact set the current static bake can use well: a point, a rectangle
//! (a panel, a sign face, a screen), and a line (a tube, a neon strip, a
//! fluorescent batten). A cone/spot light needs a directional response model
//! the light model does not provide, so it is deliberately not supported.
//!
//! Falloff
//! -------
//! Every light has a `range` and a `falloff` curve. The default — a 6 m smooth
//! cushion — is exactly what Places has always baked, so a light that does not
//! author either keeps the historical look bit-for-bit.
