//! The per-texel light evaluation of one lightmap chart.
//!
//! A chart is a rectangle of atlas texels covering one planar patch of static
//! geometry. Filling it is the whole lightmap pass: for every texel, evaluate
//! the baked lighting at the corresponding world position and write the result
//! as a linear RGB triple. The bake itself is
//! [`crate::lighting::LevelLighting`]; this module owns only the texel walk,
//! the patch-to-world mapping and the output ordering the atlas builder and the
//! shader both rely on.
//!
//! Contract (frozen between the mesh emitter, this pass and the renderer):
//!
//! * `chart.height` rows of `chart.width` RGB triples, row-major.
//! * Row `j` runs along the patch's `v` axis, column `i` along `u`.
//! * The texels *span* the patch: texel `i` of `width` samples
//!   `u = i / (width - 1)`, so the first and last texel sit exactly on the
//!   patch's geometric edges (a one-texel axis samples the middle). The same
//!   holds along `v`.
//! * Values are linear display-space light, the same units as
//!   [`crate::lighting::LevelLighting::sample_in_room`], clamped per channel to
//!   `[AMBIENT_LEVEL, MAX_BRIGHTNESS]` exactly like the vertex bake.
//!
//! Why the edges are exact
//! -----------------------
//! The atlas is sampled bilinearly, and a chart's gutter is a copy of its own
//! border texel, so a fragment on a patch's geometric edge reconstructs exactly
//! that border texel's value. Sampling texel *centres* therefore made every
//! edge reconstruct the light half a texel *inside* its own patch. Two
//! coplanar patches sharing an edge (two albedo materials on one floor, two
//! length runs of one wall, two charts of one surface split at the chart-span
//! cap) then each reconstructed their own inward-shifted value, and since the
//! shifts point in opposite directions the pair formed a first-order step of
//! `g * (tA + tB) / 2` — a visible lighting seam at every material boundary,
//! even though the lighting itself is continuous there.
//!
//! Spanning the patch inclusively removes it at the source: both charts
//! evaluate the *same world point* on the shared edge and store it in the texel
//! that edge reconstructs. Nothing has to be matched, stitched or averaged, and
//! a genuine discontinuity — a 90-degree corner, a wall, another room — is
//! untouched because those samples are different world points to begin with.
//!
//! The evaluation goes through
//! [`crate::lighting::LevelLighting::lightmap_texel`], which is
//! `sample_in_room` without the wall-clearing walk: a texel is generated on a
//! surface plane, and the fast path returns exactly the same value as the
//! vertex bake for every texel that is not buried in a wall.
//!
//! Two details keep a *vertical* face honest, because its texels are generated
//! exactly on a solid boundary:
//!
//! * every wall/skirt texel is nudged one
//!   [`LIGHTMAP_FACE_NORMAL_BIAS_M`](super::super::tuning::LIGHTMAP_FACE_NORMAL_BIAS_M)
//!   along its patch normal, the same nudge the vertex bake applies to a face
//!   sample, so the texel is evaluated in the air the face opens into;
//! * a texel that is still inside a wall solid — a junction with a crossing
//!   wall, or the outermost floor/ceiling row where a wall is authored across
//!   the room boundary — takes the walked
//!   [`crate::lighting::LevelLighting::sample_in_room`] path instead, exactly
//!   like the vertex bake.
//!
//! With both, `fill_chart` reproduces the vertex bake's values on the shipped
//! demo where the two paths are meant to agree.
