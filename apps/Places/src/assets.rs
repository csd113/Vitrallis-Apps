//! Authoritative asset catalog: logical ids, classification and resource paths.
//!
//! Levels never store where an asset file lives. They store a logical id
//! (`core:desk`, `spooner-man`); the catalog in `assets/catalog.json` maps that
//! id to its
//!
//! * **asset class** — `environment`, `entity`, `core` or `diagnostic`;
//! * **asset type** — `prop`, `material`, `texture`, `light`, `decal`, `entity`;
//! * **theme** — an organizational environment collection such as `office` or
//!   `pool`, absent for generic/shared content;
//! * **source** — a file below the asset root (`assets/`) or a resource the
//!   renderer generates in code;
//! * **resource** — the canonical model path relative to the asset root.
//!
//! Classification is organizational only. Nothing in the runtime filters
//! placement by theme or class: an Office fixture may light a Pool level, a
//! Pool decal may sit in an Office corridor and an entity may stand in any
//! room. Themes exist for discoverability, documentation and future tools, not
//! for restriction.
//!
//! The catalog is data, not code. Adding a theme is adding a `themes` record;
//! adding a future class or type is a validated identifier, so an unknown value
//! never corrupts lookup. Physical files can move between directories without
//! rewriting a single level, because levels only ever reference the logical id.
