//! Surface-coincidence regression tests for the level geometry builder.
//!
//! The builder may emit two coplanar triangles only when the level genuinely
//! asks for it (an intentionally overlapping prop, two rooms a creator placed
//! on top of each other). It must never emit a *coincident* pair as a
//! by-product of how it derives walls, openings, thresholds or groups: two
//! surfaces at the same depth fight for the same pixels, and the loser flickers
//! as the camera moves. Face culling is off, so a triangle facing one way and
//! one facing the other still compete; the audit checks both.
//!
//! The invariant holds for the architecture kinds — floors, ceilings and walls.
//! Decals are deliberately offset from their parent surface and prop boxes
//! deliberately rest on the floor, so those contact planes are permitted by the
//! features themselves.
//!
//! These tests build real meshes through the same entry point the game uses and
//! measure the emitted triangles, rather than asserting that a level parses.
//! The `places_demo` case is the shipped acceptance check: it must emit no
//! coincident architecture surface at all.

// Test code: unwrap/expect, indexing, loose casts and permissive arithmetic are idiomatic in tests;
// the production lints stay enforced everywhere else in the crate.
