//! Selective reflections: which surfaces reflect, and how.
//!
//! A reflection is the one thing in this renderer that samples something the
//! bake did not produce. It is therefore opt-in *per material* and deliberately
//! limited: three modes, one strength, no screen-space ray marching.
//!
//! ```text
//! mode    source                                        cost
//! none    nothing (the default; no mode authored)           -
//! probe   one static cubemap baked at level load,        one texture read
//!         read by the reflection vector                  per fragment
//! planar  a second view of the level through the         one scene pass
//!         marked plane, drawn once per frame             per active plane
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties keep this honest next to the rest of the material model:
//!
//! * **It rides on the existing response numbers.** The reflected colour is
//!   weighted by the material's own specular colour, its roughness and the view
//!   angle, so a surface that authors no sheen never reflects and a rough one
//!   suppresses what it does catch. There is no separate "reflectivity" to keep
//!   in sync with the sheen.
//! * **It is approximate and says so.** A probe is a 64-texel-per-face cubemap
//!   baked once; a planar reflection is half resolution. Both are images of the
//!   room, not of the light transport, and neither is expected to survive close
//!   inspection. They exist to make a wet floor and a mirror read as wet and
//!   mirrored.
//!
//! Marking is done in the catalog: `"reflection": {"mode": "planar",
//! "strength": 0.55}`. Nothing in a level file changes, and a material used on
//! two different planes (a wall panel reused on the floor) is resolved per
//! batch at build time by the renderer, which derives the plane from the
//! geometry actually emitted.
