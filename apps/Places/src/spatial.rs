//! Coarse spatial partitioning and view-frustum culling for static geometry.
//!
//! The renderer used to submit one draw per material for the whole level, so a
//! camera pointed away from a prop field still paid almost the full vertex cost
//! (measured on the historical `PocketCHIP` target: 400 chairs behind the camera
//! cost ~28 ms against ~36 ms in front of it). This module provides the two
//! pieces needed to stop that: a world-space axis-aligned bounding box per
//! render batch, and a conservative box/frustum intersection test.
//!
//! The partitioning is deliberately simple — a uniform X/Z grid, no Y
//! subdivision, no hierarchy, no occlusion queries, nothing beyond what OpenGL
//! ES 2.0 needs. A cell is a column of space that covers the full height of
//! whatever stands in it, which stays correct for elevated rooms, gable
//! ceilings and recessed floors: `LevelSurfaces` supplies the vertical extent,
//! and batching only needs the X/Z footprint. Rooms stacked at the same X/Z
//! share a cell, so they share draw ranges; that is a batching granularity
//! limit, not a correctness one.
//!
//! Everything here is `no_std`-friendly pure math plus one `HashMap`-backed
//! builder; nothing allocates per frame.
