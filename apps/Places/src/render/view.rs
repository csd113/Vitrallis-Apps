///   switch: with lightmaps unavailable it is zero and every vertex takes the
///   vertex-lit path, which is what makes the fallback exact rather than
///   approximate. The atlas is only sampled inside the guard that selects

/// * **Emission** — the material's own brightness, added on top and never
///   multiplied by the light. A dark room cannot extinguish it, and it cannot
///   brighten anything else: emission is not a light source.
/// * **Sheen** — the material's lightweight surface response: a view-dependent
///   Fresnel term scaled by the baked light, optionally perturbed by a normal
///   map. See [`crate::materials::response`]. Zero for every material that
///   authors none. Its `u_specular` colour is the material's identity and its
///   `u_roughness` is `1 - shine`: the tight lobe shrinks with the gloss, so a
///   matte surface keeps the broad grazing sheen and loses the flat face-on
///   glow.
/// * **Reflection** — `u_reflect_mode` selects the static probe or the planar
///   image, weighted by `u_reflect_strength` (already the material's specular
///   colour times its authored strength), a Fresnel term and the same gloss.
///   A rough surface only catches the image near grazing angles and reads a
///   broad cone of it; a polished one reflects across the whole face.
/// * **Dynamic probe** — `u_light_scale` is `1` for static geometry. The
///   dynamic-object path sets it to the baked light sampled at the object's
///   current position, so a moving object is shaded coherently without touching
///   its vertex buffer.
///
/// `u_emission_vertex` selects which value feeds the emissive term. Ordinary
/// materials use the per-batch `u_emission_color` (their `emissive x
/// intensity`, modulated by the emissive mask when one is bound, and by the
/// surface texture so artwork shapes the glow). Fixture faces use `1.0`, which
/// makes the per-vertex colour the emission source: their glow is per instance
/// (a neutral emission strength, so the sheet keeps its own colour) while the
