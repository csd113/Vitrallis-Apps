"""Pool prop parts.

The Pool family: white moulded-resin patio furniture, a chrome pool ladder,
pale privacy-curtain screens and silver guardrails.  Each entry is
``{"core:<id>": build_function}`` exactly like the other part modules; the
catalogue is the authoritative list of ids and sizes.

The set is one family: a clean, relatively new, sterile institutional pool.
Everything is pale -- white resin furniture, chrome ladder, dull-silver
guardrails and pale privacy curtains -- and the wear is deliberately light (a
few faint scuffs, no rust, no mould) because the Pool is empty, not abandoned.
Colours come from :mod:`palette`; the catalogue ``size`` is the authoritative
bounding box and the origin is the floor-contact centre.

Construction conventions
------------------------

* **Modular bays on a 0.6 m grid.**  The straight / end / corner modules of
  both the curtain and the guardrail compose into runs.  Every module puts its
  end posts inboard by the post radius (or by the foot-plate half-width for the
  curtains) so the post surface, and a guardrail's base flange, are flush with
  the module's catalogue edge.  Two modules placed edge to edge in a level
  therefore meet piece to piece with no gap and no overlap, and their rails
  butt into one continuous line.
* **A rail always dies at a post.**  A guardrail or curtain rail spans its
  whole module and terminates inside (or immediately behind) the end post, so a
  run reads as one continuous rail and a lone module still shows a finished
  end.  No rail is left with a raw open end.
* **One guardrail rail.**  The guardrail is a single waist-high (1.05 m) pipe
  rail: three posts to a 2 m bay, one Ø42 rail at ~0.98 m, Ø48 posts with
  turned caps and bolted rectangular base flanges.  It is deliberately *not* a
  two-rail fence.
* **Moulded resin is faceted, metal is turned.**  Table and chair legs are
  four-sided tapered blocks (a 4-segment lathe rotated 45 degrees) rather than
  round tubes; metal work is eight-sided tube or round stock with painted
  lengthwise highlights, so the two material families never read alike.
* **Cloth is gathered.**  A curtain panel is a double-sided folded ribbon built
  in two bands: the top 0.26 m fans out from the track (pleats almost closed
  where they hang) and the body below hangs with vertical fold faces at the
  full depth, which is what real gathered cloth does and what keeps the painted
  header tape and hem square on the model.  Small roller carriers sit over the
  gathered pleat crests.
* **+Z is each module's front**: the ladder's handrails curve towards +Z (over
  the deck edge), the curtain pleats open towards +Z, and the guardrail and
  curtain faces are symmetric about it.
