"""Light fixture surface artwork: the visible face of every built-in fixture.

A fixture's *mesh* is generated geometry (a panel, a shallow can, a wall
housing), but what that geometry shows is ordinary external PNG artwork exactly
like a decal sheet: the catalog's `asset_type: "light"` entry names the sheet,
the renderer resolves it through the shared catalog -> PNG -> texture-cache
path, and replacing the PNG needs no Rust change and no recompilation.

Each sheet is the fixture's own visible surface, mapped once across the face it
draws (no world tiling, so nothing here is tileable and nothing wraps):

* ``core:fluorescent_panel_01`` -- 256x128, the flat luminous panel face. Image
  ``x`` is the panel's 1.2 m width axis and image ``y`` its 0.6 m depth axis, so
  one texel is 4.7 mm in both directions. The artwork is a twin-tube diffuser:
  two soft tube bands under an off-white acrylic sheet, a restrained falloff
  towards the frame, fine grain and a little dust along the edges. It must read
  as a *surface*, never as baked illumination: the room lighting is the bake's
  job (see ``src/lighting.rs``).
* ``core:pool_light_round`` -- 128x128, the round diffuser seen face-on: image
  centre is the fixture centre, the inscribed circle is the diffuser's own
  radius (0.22 m), and one texel is 3.9 mm. Concentric moulding rings, faint
  radial ribs, a bright lamp core and a dark contact line where the diffuser
  meets its bezel.
* ``core:pool_light_wall`` -- 128x64, the wall luminaire's lens face: 0.4 m
  wide by 0.2 m tall, 3.1 mm per texel. An opal cover with a soft horizontal
  lamp band, vertical ribbing and a slightly shadowed cover edge.

The palette stays pale and near-neutral on purpose: the fixture's vertex colour
is a *neutral* emission strength (the intensity response, never the authored
light colour) multiplied into the sampled texel, so an off fixture darkens this
artwork to black without any code knowing about the texture, while a coloured
light changes only the illumination it bakes into the room.

Everything is deterministic -- only :mod:`artkit` helpers, no randomness, no
clock, no external images.
