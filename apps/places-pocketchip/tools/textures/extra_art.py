"""Surface artwork: glass, polished floors, panels and normal maps.

These are ordinary surface sheets like every other file in this directory: the
game loads the PNGs at level load and never runs this script.  They exist so
the lightweight surface response has real artwork to
demonstrate rather than procedures:

``core:tex_glass_clear_01``
    Nearly transparent sheet: a faint green-grey tint and an alpha channel that
    lets almost everything through.  Tiles, because a window pane still samples
    a material at its own ``tile_metres``.
``core:tex_glass_dirty_01``
    The same sheet with grime: blotchy alpha and a warm-grey film, so a pane
    reads as unwashed rather than as clean glass with a texture on it.
``core:tex_glass_tinted_01``
    A uniformly tinted teal sheet at roughly half opacity.
``core:tex_linoleum_01``
    Polished linoleum: pale speckled sheet with faint seams.
``core:tex_metal_panel_01``
    Brushed metal: cold grey with fine horizontal brushing and a seam.
``core:tex_plastic_panel_01``
    Moulded plastic: pale, near-neutral, with a soft periodic sheen.
``core:tex_normal_panel_01``, ``core:tex_normal_brushed_01``
    Two tangent-space normal maps.  Both are *tileable generic detail*, not
    aligned to any albedo pattern: a panel gets soft moulded dimples, a metal
    sheet fine horizontal brushing.  They are stored as ordinary RGB normals
    (x and y in the red and green channels, z in blue) with a flat alpha, which
    is what the fragment shader decodes.

``core:tex_white_01``
    The shared untextured white sheet, a solid opaque 2x2 fill.  It is not
    artwork: it is the neutral sheet the renderer binds to fixture housings,
    plain body geometry and any texture slot that has nothing else, so it is
    deliberately the smallest valid PNG.  It is catalogued like every other
    shipped texture and loaded by the renderer at startup, never generated in
    Rust.

Painting rules match the rest of the texture set: deterministic helpers only,
no randomness, no clock, no external images, and every pattern period divides
the sheet so the sheet tiles.
