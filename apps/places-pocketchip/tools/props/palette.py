"""Shared colour palette for the liminal-rust core prop pack.

Every prop in the pack draws its colours from this module so the twenty
finished assets read as one coherent, faded, institutional/domestic set at
480x272.  Keep additions muted: no neon, no saturated showroom plastics.

Colours are stored as ``#rrggbb`` strings (the same spelling the prop
catalogue uses) and converted to 0..255 tuples on demand.
