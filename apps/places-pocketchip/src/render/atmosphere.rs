//! Lightweight atmospheric distance fog.
//!
//! Fog is the one part of the post-processing brief that lives in the world
//! fragment shader rather than in a separate pass: it has to be applied per
//! fragment anyway, it costs no extra draw and no extra target, and keeping it
//! in the world shader means the historical direct (no-offscreen) path still
//! gets it. Bloom, exposure and grading live in [`super::postprocess`] instead,
//! because they need the finished image.
//!
//! The model is exponential-squared distance fog with a mild height term:
//!
//! ```text
//! density(x) = density * (1 + height_gain * max(0, reference_y - y))
//! amount     = 1 - exp(-(density(x) * distance)^2)
//! ```
//!
//! Both constants are deliberately small. The shipped interiors are at most
//! about 30 m across, so the fog only becomes visible where the building is
//! genuinely deep — a long corridor, the far end of the pool hall, the unmade
//! world through the last doorway — and never turns a room smoky. The height
//! term gives the air a touch more body near the floor without a volumetric
//! pass: it is a gradient on a scalar, not a light shaft.

/// How the air is tinted and how thick it is.
