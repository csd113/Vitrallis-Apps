//! Dynamic objects: the moving half of the scene.
//!
//! The static renderer bakes every surface, fixture and placed prop once at
//! level load into shared, pre-transformed vertex buffers, and the frame loop
//! only submits ranges and samples the baked light. **Nothing in this module
//! rebuilds, re-bakes or re-uploads static geometry.** A dynamic object is a
//! different kind of thing with a different lifetime:
//!
//! ```text
//! static                              dynamic (this module)
//! ------                              ----------------------
//! authored in the level JSON          spawned by game code, never in the level
//! transformed once at level load      transformed every frame (matrix only)
//! baked into LevelMesh / prop batch   uploaded once in model space
//! baked light in vertex colour        baked light in the u_light_gain uniform
//! part of the lightmap occlusion set  invisible to the baker and to collision
//! ```
//!
//! Representation
//! --------------
//! [`DynamicScene`] owns a bounded, ordered list of [`DynamicObject`]s and one
//! [`DynamicMesh`] per distinct model. A mesh is the *same*
//! [`crate::props::LoadedPropAsset`] the static prop path resolves, converted
//! once into render vertices in **model space**; its textures are the same
//! `Rc`-shared decoded images, so spawning a drum that is also placed statically
//! decodes nothing twice.
//!
//! A transform is translation + yaw about Y + uniform scale. It is deliberately
//! not a general matrix: a dynamic object is a rigid prop-like thing, and
//! keeping the rotation to one axis keeps the demo, the probe maths and the
//! tests exact. The renderer composes `view_projection * transform` into the
//! existing `u_mvp` uniform per object, so moving an object costs one uniform
//! upload and never touches a vertex buffer.
//!
//! Lighting (probe-based)
//! ----------------------
//! Baked static light cannot follow a moving object, so each object carries a
//! **probe**: the baked [`LevelLighting::sample`] value at its world-space
//! centre, refreshed only when the object has moved by more than
//! [`PROBE_EPSILON_M`]. The renderer feeds the probe through the world
//! program's `u_light_gain` uniform, and the object's per-vertex colour carries
//! albedo/tint only — exactly like a lightmapped static vertex. The object then
//! reads coherently as it crosses a pool of light and a dark corner.
//!
//! Documented limits of that model:
//!
//! * **One probe per object.** The whole object is lit uniformly; a long object
//!   lying across a light/dark boundary cannot shade across its length.
//! * **No self-occlusion and no shadows.** The probe is the room's baked light
//!   at the object's centre, so the object does not darken the floor beneath it,
//!   does not shadow itself and casts no shadow of any kind.
//! * **Static light only.** The probe reads the level's bake; light emitted by
//!   other dynamic objects, or by anything that moves, never contributes.
//! * **The probe is a snapshot.** Because it is refreshed on movement, a light
//!   change (there is none at runtime today) would not be picked up until the
//!   object moved.
