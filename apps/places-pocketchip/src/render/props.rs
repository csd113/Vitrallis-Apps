//! Prop instancing and lighting.
//!
//! Every placed instance of one model is transformed and lit on the CPU at
//! level load time and appended to a per-model batch, so the renderer binds one
//! buffer per model and issues one draw call per *primitive* of all of its
//! instances. A prop with no usable asset falls back to a placeholder box.
//!
//! Materials
//! ---------
//! A production GLB may split one model into several primitives, each with its
//! own material, texture and emission. Instances are accumulated per
//! `(model, spatial cell)` and their index lists are grouped by primitive, so a
//! model with three primitives costs three draws per cell no matter how many
//! times it is placed — a field of vending machines still batches. A single
//! primitive model behaves exactly as it always has: one range, one draw.
