//! Real baked static lightmaps for the static world geometry.
//!
//! The lightmap path adds one thing on top of the baked-vertex lighting model:
//! the light that the vertex-colour path carries is instead baked into a texel
//! atlas, and the fragment shader multiplies the surface texture by the atlas
//! texel. Nothing about the *lighting model* changes — every texel is one
//! [`crate::lighting::LevelLighting::sample_in_room`] call — only where the
//! result is stored.
//!
//! ```text
//! mesh emitter                    atlas builder (bake time)
//!    quad -> LightmapPatch      fill_chart() -> chart.width x chart.height RGB
//!         -> Chart                 -> page texels + dilated gutter
//!         -> Vertex::lightmap       -> one RGB8 texture per page
//! ```
//!
//! The vertex-lit path stays alive as an exact fallback: a vertex whose
//! [`crate::render::LIGHTMAP_NONE`] page byte is set never samples the atlas,
//! and a build whose lightmaps could not be produced is rebuilt with
//! [`LightmapMode::Off`], which reproduces the historical vertex colours.
