//! Static light visibility: does solid geometry stand between a light and a
//! surface sample?
//!
//! The baked lighting model sums a room baseline and a local pool per fixture.
//! A pool is a distance falloff, so without this module a fixture could light
//! any surface inside [`super::LOCAL_LIGHT_RADIUS_M`] even with opaque geometry
//! in between — the cross-wall bleed and RGB contamination that the wall-boundary
//! repair exists to remove, and (for stacked rooms) the floor-to-floor light
//! leak the vertical-isolation work exists to remove. This module answers one
//! question, once per level load and never per frame:
//!
//! ```text
//! what fraction of a fixture's emitting rectangle can a surface sample see?
//! ```
//!
//! [`Visibility::occludes`] is the historical binary answer — one segment from
//! the emitter's closest point — and [`Visibility::visible_fraction`] is its
//! sampled generalisation: the emitter is covered by a fixed tap pattern and the
//! visible fraction of that area becomes the pool's weight, which is what turns
//! a hard shadow edge into a penumbra. [`ShadowSampling::HARD`] reproduces
//! `occludes` exactly, so the vertex-lit fallback and every historical test keep
//! their values bit for bit.
//!
//! The geometry it tests is exactly the solid geometry the renderer emits and
//! collision walks through, in three groups:
//!
//! * **Walls.** Every wall is split by
//!   [`crate::level::wall_solid_slices_profiled`] into the same solid columns
//!   the wall mesh and collision use, and each patch of solid wall becomes one
//!   world-space axis-aligned box. A door, window, passage or vent removes the
//!   box it cuts, so a segment that crosses a solid box is blocked while a
//!   segment that passes through an opening's own footprint and height is not;
//!   the solid header above a door still blocks; a low wall or a raised wall
//!   blocks only up to its real top.
//! * **Floor interfaces.** Every floor-grid cell of every room contributes a
//!   zero-thickness horizontal interface at its own surface height. An
//!   interface blocks a segment whose endpoints are on opposite sides of the
//!   plane within the cell's footprint, and nothing else: because it has no
//!   thickness it can never occupy a room's air, so a raised platform, a
//!   staircase step and a lowered basin inside one volume are not mistaken for
//!   sealed floors, and a fixture hanging just below its room's ceiling is
//!   never swallowed by the room above's floor.
//! * **Ceiling slabs.** Every ceiling-grid cell contributes a thin box that
//!   starts *at* the ceiling plane and extends upward. It gives a gable roof a
//!   solid stepped body without ever reaching into the room's own air, so a
//!   segment that enters through the roof from the side is still stopped.
//! * **Static prop bodies.** Every placed prop contributes the boxes derived
//!   from its real model triangles ([`super::occlusion`]), transformed by its
//!   placement: uniform scale, yaw about Y and translation. They are a
//!   separate list on purpose — the wall-only point-containment and
//!   partition-connectivity queries must not see furniture, so a floor sample
//!   under a couch is shaded by the couch rather than walked out from under
//!   it.
//!
//! The boxes are the exact solid extents: they are never inflated or shrunk.
//! Two pieces that meet in the mesh — the wall beside a window, the wall a
//! corner abuts — therefore meet in the visibility set too, with no slit
//! between them. A query that starts exactly on a face is handled by pushing
//! its start point [`SEGMENT_START_EPS_M`] along its own direction instead.
//!
//! Endpoint semantics
//! ------------------
//! A segment whose endpoint lies exactly on a solid's face is **not** blocked
//! by that face: the slab clip requires strictly overlapping parameter ranges.
//! That is what lets a surface sample sit exactly on its own floor or ceiling
//! plane and still receive the light of the fixture it belongs to, while a
//! segment that genuinely crosses the body is blocked.
//!
//! Boxes are collected per *query site*: one range of solid indices per
//! fixture or opening, holding only the solids whose horizontal bounds reach
//! the site's radius. A segment between two points that are both inside the
//! radius cannot leave that disc, so the prefilter is exact rather than
//! approximate. That keeps one visibility query proportional to the few solids
//! near the fixture instead of to the whole level.
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic: boxes are built in wall order then room
//! order, columns in ascending length order and spans in ascending height
//! order, and a query walks its range in index order.
