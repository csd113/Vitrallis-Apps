# Places asset architecture

`assets/catalog.json` is the authoritative registry of every logical asset the
game and its tooling know about. Levels reference assets by **logical id**
(`core:desk`, `spooner-man`, `core:carpet_beige_01`); the catalog maps that id to
everything else: its class, its optional environment theme, its type and its
canonical resource.

Nothing outside the catalog cares where a file lives. Moving a model or a
texture PNG between directories never requires editing a level.

```
logical id            core:desk / spooner-man / core:carpet_beige_01   (stable; levels store this)
    ↓
catalog metadata      assets/catalog.json                             (class, theme, type, resource)
    ↓
canonical resource    assets/<path>                                   (one physical file per asset)
    ↓
runtime cache         PropAssets / TextureCache / MaterialTable       (decoded once, reused)
```

Surface materials add one more link to that chain:

```
material id           core:carpet_beige_01        (levels store this)
    ↓                 catalog `texture` reference
texture id            core:tex_carpet_beige_01
    ↓                 catalog `model` path, relative to assets/
external PNG          environment/office/textures/floors/carpet_beige_01.png
    ↓                 decoded once per session, uploaded once per level
renderer material     texture + tile_metres + tint
```

## Quick start

```sh
python3 tools/assets/validate.py             # catalog, resources, shipped levels
python3 tools/textures/build.py --check      # surface PNGs exist, parse and fit their budget
python3 tools/props/build.py --check         # prop models exist and fit their budgets
cargo test
cd level-editor && npm test
```

## The catalog

```json
{
  "format_version": 2,
  "themes": [
    { "id": "office", "display_name": "Office", "description": "..." },
    { "id": "pool",   "display_name": "Pool",   "description": "..." }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "id": "core:desk",
      "display_name": "Desk",
      "asset_class": "environment",
      "theme": "office",
      "asset_type": "prop",
      "source": "file",
      "model": "environment/office/props/models/desk.glb",
      "size": [1.6, 0.75, 0.7],
      "color": "#5f5142",
      "category": "Furniture",
      "solid": true
    },
    {
      "id": "core:tex_wallpaper_yellow_01",
      "display_name": "Yellow Wallpaper Texture",
      "asset_class": "environment",
      "theme": "office",
      "asset_type": "texture",
      "source": "file",
      "model": "environment/office/textures/walls/wallpaper_yellow_01.png"
    },
    {
      "id": "core:wallpaper_yellow_01",
      "display_name": "Yellow Wallpaper",
      "asset_class": "environment",
      "theme": "office",
      "asset_type": "material",
      "source": "definition",
      "surface": "wall",
      "texture": "core:tex_wallpaper_yellow_01",
      "tile_metres": 2.0,
      "tint": [0.85, 0.80, 0.42]
    }
  ]
}
```

Only `id`, `asset_class` and `asset_type` are required. Missing optional fields
inherit neutral fallbacks, and unknown future fields are ignored by this build.
The loader also accepts the legacy `props` array from the old flat registry, so
older tooling keeps parsing.

### Identity (`id`)

The stable name a level stores. Ids are non-empty names such as `core:chair`,
`office:monitor` or `spooner-man`; they never contain whitespace or path
separators, so a level can never smuggle a filesystem path in through an id.
Duplicate ids are a catalog error: the loader rejects the document instead of
letting the last entry win.

### Class (`asset_class`)

Broad semantic classification. `environment` and `entity` are the two classes
the game ships; `core` is the home for engine-level shared resources and
`diagnostic` for development content. Classes are validated identifiers, so a
future class parses and resolves without an engine change; tooling reports
unknown classes so typos (`enviroment`) cannot slip through.

### Theme (`theme`)

An organizational environment collection, absent for generic/shared content.
The built-in themes are **`office`**, **`pool`** and **`home`**. Themes are data:
add a `themes` record and a future `hotel`/`school` theme resolves without
touching Rust.

**Themes organize, they never restrict.** There is no code path that rejects an
asset because a room has a different theme; the runtime deliberately exposes no
theme-filtering query. Place Office assets in a Pool level, mix Office and Pool
in one room, or use an entity anywhere — placement is by id, nothing else.
Rooms have no mandatory theme field.

### Type (`asset_type`)

What the resource is: `prop`, `material`, `texture`, `light`, `decal` or
`entity`. Type is independent of class and theme. `prop` and `entity` assets are
*placeable* (they go through the ordinary model pipeline); materials, textures,
lights and decals are referenced by id.

### Source and resource (`source`, `model`, `texture`)

* `"source": "file"` assets name a `model` path **relative to this directory**.
  The runtime joins it onto the resolved asset root; one asset has exactly one
  canonical file. Props and entities name a `.glb`, **textures**, file-backed
  **decals** and **lights** name a `.png` (a surface sheet, a decal cut-out and
  a fixture's visible face respectively).
* `"source": "definition"` assets are data definitions composed from other
  catalog assets. A `material` names the logical `texture` it draws with, plus
  any render parameters (`tile_metres`, `tint`); it has no file of its own and
  must not declare `model`.
* `"source": "generated"` assets (the diagnostic decal atlas pattern) have no
  file. The renderer generates them in code; the catalog records their identity
  and classification so themes and future tools can see them.

## Surface materials and textures

A **material** is the game-facing surface definition a level names: it carries
the world-space tiling period and the static tint, and it points at a
**texture** asset that owns the PNG. Splitting the two is what keeps identity
stable: a level always names the material, so the artwork behind it can be
replaced or the file moved without touching a level.

* `"texture"` — the logical id of a `texture` asset. **Required** for every
  material; a material without one is a catalog error.
* `"tile_metres"` — world metres covered by one repeat of the texture, in both
  directions (default `2.0`, allowed `0.05`–`64`). A wall passes its length and
  height, a floor/ceiling its `x`/`z`, and both divide by this value at the
  material's tiling, so a two-metre sheet is still a two-metre sheet when the
  image becomes external.
* `"tint"` — three channels in `0..1` multiplied into the sampled texture
  (default `[1, 1, 1]`). The built-in office surfaces use it to keep their
  historical look: wallpaper `[0.85, 0.80, 0.42]`, ceiling
  `[0.72, 0.72, 0.70]`.
* `"surface"` — `wall`, `floor` or `ceiling`, documentation/validation only.
  The geometry being emitted decides which surface family a material draws on;
  a level may use any material on any surface.

Texture assets are just files:

* `"model"` must be a `.png` path relative to `assets/`; other extensions are a
  catalog error and a missing/undecodable file is a level-load error with the
  material id in the message.
* PNG dimensions are read from the file, not the catalog. The policy lives in
  `src/assets.rs` (`ShippedTextureKind`, `MAX_TEXTURE_DIMENSION`,
  `PREFERRED_TEXTURE_DIMENSION`, `MAX_SURFACE_TEXTURE_BYTES`): the hard runtime
  ceiling is 1024×1024, 256×256 is a soft tooling preference for new sheets,
  and one surface sheet may decode to at most 4 MiB of RGBA8. The runtime
  accepts any non-zero size up to the ceiling and normalises RGB, RGBA,
  grayscale, grayscale+alpha, palette and 16-bit images to RGBA8. Exceeding the
  soft preference is a tooling warning, never an error: the upgraded Office and
  Pool surface sheets are intentionally 1024×1024.
* **Surface sheets are square**, because the renderer samples them as square
  `tile_metres` cells and a non-square wall/floor/ceiling sheet would stretch.
  They are not power-of-two constrained: the desktop GL path loads NPOT fine
  and the runtime accepts it, though POT stays preferred for the ES 2.0
  portability target.
* **Decal sheets and fixture faces must be power-of-two** on both edges. They
  are fitted, sampled with mipmaps and never repeat, and OpenGL ES 2.0 does not
  guarantee NPOT + mipmapping. `tools/textures/build.py --check` reports a
  non-POT sheet as a warning (the runtime decoder itself accepts it); the
  shipped-asset policy in `src/assets.rs` and its tests treat it as a
  violation. The one deliberate exception is the 96×64
  `core:tex_diagnostic_alt_01` surface, which exists to prove the NPOT load
  path and is asserted explicitly where it is loaded.
* Surface textures are uploaded with `REPEAT` wrapping and mipmaps. Alpha is
  decoded and preserved, and whether it is *used* is the material's
  `alpha_mode`: `opaque` (the default) writes every texel, `cutout` discards
  texels below the cut-off and writes the rest opaquely, and `blend` draws the
  surface in the sorted translucent pass. The shipped glass and lit-sign
  materials author `blend`, and the transfer grille authors `cutout`, so a
  surface PNG may carry alpha when its material asks for it; a material that
  names no `alpha_mode` still ignores the channel.
* Fixture faces are **fitted**, not tiled: their UVs never leave the sheet, so
  they are uploaded with `CLAMP_TO_EDGE` wrapping and mipmaps. A fixture PNG
  must therefore be *complete* artwork — no bleeding margin is needed, and a
  power-of-two size keeps the mip chain exact on the ES 2.0 target. Decal
  sheets are fitted too, but are uploaded with `REPEAT` (see below).

### Decal sheets

Decals are small local surface markings (signs, floor arrows, warning marks)
placed on an existing surface. A level names them the same way it names a
material — by logical id in its `decals` array — and the catalog decides where
the pixels come from:

* `"source": "file"` decal assets are **external PNG sheets**, exactly like a
  surface texture: the entry names the `.png` file under `assets/`, the runtime
  decodes it once per session and uploads it as its own decal sheet, and a
  creator replaces the PNG and restarts. Three ship:
  `core:decal_no_diving_01` (the Pool safety sign),
  `core:decal_arrow_01` (a floor-direction arrow) and
  `core:decal_stripes_01` (diagonal hazard bands).
* `"source": "generated"` decals are drawn into one shared atlas by the
  renderer. Only `core:decal_test_01` — the internal validation marking — is
  still generated, because it exists to exercise the atlas machinery rather
  than to be edited. The atlas's other three cells stay transparent.

Adding an editable decal of your own is the same two steps as a surface
material: add the PNG, then add a `decal` entry naming it. `tools/textures/`
regenerates the three shipped sheets deterministically if you want a starting
point.

Decal sheets need **power-of-two** dimensions (they are sampled with mipmaps
and `REPEAT` wrapping) and an alpha cut-out: the decal pass discards every texel
below alpha 0.5, so the background is alpha 0 and the artwork is the silhouette
plus its plate. The sheet is drawn in the decal pass with a fixed polygon
offset, so it wins the coincident-depth test against the surface it lies on and
still receives the baked lighting of the room it is in. An authoring workflow
lives in `tools/textures/README.md`; a missing or undecodable sheet draws the
same magenta/black diagnostic a broken surface texture does, with the decal id
in the console message.

### Light fixtures

A placed light names a `fixture` id from the catalog's `asset_type: "light"`
entries, and that id selects both the fixture appearance and the luminous
footprint the bake treats as a light source. The built-in families are:

| fixture id | appearance | mounting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core:fluorescent_panel_01` | recessed 1.2 x 0.6 m twin-tube office panel | ceiling (height derived from the room) |
| `core:pool_light_round` | round recessed downlight, 0.44 m | ceiling (height derived from the room) |
| `core:pool_light_wall` | shallow wall luminaire | wall: needs `"mount": "wall"` and a world `"y"` |
| `home:ceiling_light_round` | round residential flush mount: a shallow white drum with a glowing diffuser disc | ceiling (height derived from the room) |

A fixture's **mesh** is generated geometry, but its **visible face** is ordinary
external artwork, exactly like a decal sheet: the light entry's `model` names
the PNG, the runtime decodes it once per session through the same catalog ->
PNG -> texture-cache path a surface texture uses, and the face is drawn with the
sheet fitted once across it (no tiling). Replacing that PNG needs no Rust change
and no recompilation.

* `core:fluorescent_panel_01` — `environment/office/textures/lights/fluorescent_panel_01.png`
  (256x128): the panel face, `u` along its 1.2 m width and `v` across its 0.6 m
  depth, so one texel is 4.7 mm both ways.
* `core:pool_light_round` — `environment/pool/textures/lights/pool_light_round_01.png`
  (128x128): the diffuser seen face-on; the sheet centre is the fixture centre
  and its inscribed circle is the diffuser's outer radius.
* `core:pool_light_wall` — `environment/pool/textures/lights/pool_light_wall_01.png`
  (128x64): the lens face, `u` across its 0.4 m width and `v` up its 0.2 m
  height.
* `home:ceiling_light_round` — `environment/home/textures/lights/ceiling_light_round_01.png`
  (256x256): the diffuser seen face-on; the sheet centre is the fixture centre
  and its inscribed circle is the diffuser's outer radius. The drum, its bottom
  rim and the centre boss behind the diffuser's small centre hole are
  untextured body geometry.

Fixture appearance and emitted light are separate: `color` and `brightness` are
authored per placed light and drive both the visible panel and the illumination
the bake applies. A placed light may also author `emission`, an independent
strength for the visible face only: omitted means the face glows with the
fixture's own `brightness`, and an authored value lets a dying tube read fully
bright while casting its dim light (or a screen-like face glow without its light
being raised to match). The visible-face strength (from `emission`, or
`brightness` when it is absent) scales the fixture's vertex colour, which
multiplies into the sampled sheet, so a red fixture reddens its lamp face and an
off fixture darkens it without the artwork knowing anything. The flat metal
housing around each face is untextured geometry: it draws its authored shade
through the shared white sheet. An unknown fixture id keeps loading and draws as
the office panel with the untextured sheet, because the catalog/renderer
consistency test reports the mismatch instead of the renderer failing at load.
Adding a new appearance is a three-step asset change: the PNG, the catalog
texture entry and the light entry naming it — plus the mesh family in
`src/lighting/tuning.rs::fixture_profile`, which is still code.

### Level packs and custom textures
A `.zip` level pack can ship its own surface art without touching the catalog.
Put the PNGs under `textures/` next to `level.json` and map material ids in
`materials.json`:

```json
{
  "materials": {
    "pack:wall": { "texture": "textures/my_wall.png", "tile_metres": 3.0,
                   "tint": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] },
    "pack:carpet": { "texture": "core:tex_carpet_beige_01" }
  }
}
```

* The string form (`"pack:wall": "textures/my_wall.png"`) still parses, so old
  packs keep working.
* A `pack:` material with no mapping falls back to `textures/<name>.png` inside
  the pack, as before.
* A mapping may name a logical catalog texture id (anything with a `:`) to
  reuse shipped artwork; the pack's own `tile_metres`/`tint` still apply.
* Pack textures are decoded with the pack's namespace in the cache key, so two
  packs shipping `textures/wall.png` never share an image; the GPU copies are
  freed when the next level loads.
* A mapping that names a file the pack does not contain is a named error in
  the console, not a silent substitution.

### Adding a new surface material

No Rust change is required. From the repository root:

1. Add the PNG below `assets/`, e.g.
   `assets/environment/pool/textures/floors/pool_tile_blue_01.png`.
2. Register the **texture** in `assets/catalog.json`:

   ```json
   { "id": "pool:tex_tile_blue_01", "display_name": "Blue Pool Tile Texture",
     "asset_class": "environment", "theme": "pool", "asset_type": "texture",
     "source": "file", "model": "environment/pool/textures/floors/pool_tile_blue_01.png" }
   ```

3. Register the **material** that names it:

   ```json
   { "id": "pool:tile_blue_01", "display_name": "Blue Pool Tile",
     "asset_class": "environment", "theme": "pool", "asset_type": "material",
     "source": "definition", "surface": "floor",
     "texture": "pool:tex_tile_blue_01", "tile_metres": 2.0 }
   ```

4. Reference the material from a level (`defaults.floor`, a room, a wall face,
   a floor patch or a region).
5. Run `python3 tools/assets/validate.py` and `python3 tools/textures/build.py
   --check`, then launch the game. `python3 tools/assets/validate.py` reports
   duplicate ids, dangling texture references, missing PNGs and malformed
   metadata with the offending id in the message.

The catalog's `themes` list is data too: a `pool` theme already exists, and any
new theme id resolves without an engine change.

### Replacing a texture

Same material id, new pixels:

1. Open the PNG at the path in the texture entry (for the built-ins,
   `assets/environment/office/textures/...`).
2. Edit or replace it, keeping the file name. Keep dimensions sane; changing
   size is allowed, changing nothing else in the catalog is required.
3. Restart the game. There is no live hot reload, and **no recompilation**:
   image pixels are read at level load and decoded once per session.

This is the same for creators: `tools/textures/build.py` can regenerate the art
deterministically, but hand-painted PNGs are just as valid. The shipped
Office/Pool surfaces and the NO DIVING sign are 1024x1024 artwork, an order
larger than what the painters in `office_art.py`, `pool_art.py` and
`decal_art.py` produce; `build.py` skips a sheet whose on-disk dimensions
differ from its painter's and only overwrites with `--force`, so a plain
regeneration can never silently replace the shipped art.

### Where the artwork lives

```
assets/
  catalog.json                     authoritative registry
  prop_proxies.json                derived editor previews (never hand-edited)
  README.md                        this document
  levels/                          shipped levels (assets referenced by id)
  environment/
    office/
      props/models/*.glb           office furniture
      textures/walls/*.png         wallpaper (maintained, stained)
      textures/floors/*.png        carpet (maintained, damp)
      textures/ceilings/*.png      panel ceiling (maintained, stained)
    pool/
      props/models/*.glb           patio table and chair, curtains, ladder, guardrails
      textures/walls/*.png         wall tile
      textures/floors/*.png        deck and basin tile
      textures/ceilings/*.png      sterile ceiling
      decals/no_diving_01.png      the final safety sign (RGBA cut-out)
  core/props/models/*.glb          shared/generic props
  entities/spooner-man/model/spooner-man.glb
  diagnostic/
    textures/*.png                 architecture-test artwork (orientation, alpha, NPOT)
```

Directory neatness is the lowest priority behind compatibility: the catalog is
what the runtime reads, so files may move freely as long as the catalog follows.

## Prop and entity conventions

* 1 model unit = 1 metre; the engine is right-handed, **Y up**, floors at `y = 0`.
* The origin sits on the floor-contact point, horizontally centred under the
  object's true bounding box.
* **+Z is the front**: fridge doors, the TV screen, the vending machine panel,
  the couch seat all face `+Z` at `rotation_degrees = 0`.
* A model's bounding box must match the catalog `size` within
  `max(2 cm, 6 % of the axis)`; `tools/props/build.py` fails otherwise.
* `size` is the catalog's rendering/editor box. A level's **collision** box is
  the prop's own `size` (plus its `scale`) when authored, and the neutral
  `PROP_FALLBACK_SIZE` (0.6 x 0.9 x 0.6 m) when it is not — the catalog size is
  never collision-tested, and props are never tested against their render mesh.
  A solid prop that should block like its picture therefore authors `size` in
  the level, with the footprint's x/z swapped for a 90/270 degree rotation
  (collision boxes are axis-aligned). Intentional clipping (props sunk into
  floors, overlapping walls or objects) is allowed and never corrected.
* Levels place props with `x`, `y` (vertical offset, may be negative), `z`,
  `rotation_degrees` (Y), `scale` and an optional `size` override.

## Budgets (desktop target)

| budget     | value                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| triangles  | 50–500 preferred, ≤800 acceptable, **1500 shipped art budget** (`tools/props` refuses to build above it); the engine loads up to 6000 with an art-budget warning, and a model above 6000 falls back to a placeholder box |
| prop texture | **256×256 native** (the normal shipped size; 32/64/128 remain legal for lighter props); the engine accepts up to 1024×1024 and downscales to the runtime quality budget (Full 256, Low 128) at upload. The whole shipped pack decodes to under 4 MiB against a 64 MiB desktop pack budget |
| surface texture | Office/Pool sheets are intentionally 1024×1024 (square, opaque); 256×256 soft tooling preference, 1024×1024 hard load ceiling, ≤4 MiB decoded per sheet. Full uploads them unchanged; Low downscales to 256 |
| materials  | one material per primitive; a multi-material model costs one draw range per material per batch |
| primitives / materials / images per model | 32 / 16 / 16 |
| draw calls | one per model primitive per spatial batch (instances are baked) |

Baked vertex colours carry the per-face shading and contact darkening (the same
`PROP_FACE_SHADES` the old placeholder boxes used). A prop's fragment shader is
`texture × vertex colour` plus the material's emissive term; emission is added
on top of the baked light and never multiplied by it, so an emissive surface
stays bright in a dark room. Prop models keep the simple model: no normal maps,
no alpha, no animation, no skinning, no morph targets.

Surface materials multiply the same way: the sampled texture is scaled by the
material's `tint` and then by the baked lighting exactly like the old
code-generated sheets, so RGB lighting keeps working on external artwork. On top
of that base the catalog may author, per material:

* `emissive`, `emissive_intensity` and `emissive_mask` (a texture id) —
  **visual** brightness only, illuminating nothing around it;
* `normal_texture` (a texture id) and `normal_strength` (`0.0..=2.0`) — a
  tangent-space normal map that perturbs the shading normal;
* `specular` (a white strength, or `specular_color` for a tinted sheen) and
  `shine` (`0.0` matte .. `1.0` extremely glossy; the legacy `roughness` inverse
  is still accepted) — a view-dependent sheen added on top of the baked light,
  never a realtime light, and never a mirror;
* `alpha_mode` (`opaque`, `cutout` or `blend`), with `alpha_cutoff` and
  `opacity` — how the sampled texture's alpha combines with the framebuffer;
* `reflection_mode` (`none`, `probe` or `planar`) and `reflection_strength` — a
  selective image of the room, weighted by the material's own specular and
  shine, and blurred/dimmed as the shine drops.

A material that authors none of these draws exactly as it did before they
existed: they add terms to the baked lighting model, they never replace it.

### Runtime quality profiles

`settings.json` selects `"quality": "full"` (default) or `"low"`. Both use the
same assets: Full uploads shipped textures at their native size (surfaces and
fitted sheets 1024, prop sheets 256, emissive masks 512) with no resampling,
and Low box-filters each one once at level load (surfaces/fixtures/decals to
256, prop sheets to 128, emissive masks to 128). Low is an optional
quality/performance trade, not a hardware requirement. Sources are never
re-authored for Low, and the source hard limit (1024 px) is unchanged.

## PNG conventions for surface textures

* RGBA or RGB; 8-bit. Alpha is decoded and preserved, but a surface only uses
  the channel when its material authors `alpha_mode: "cutout"` or `"blend"`;
  an opaque material (the default) ignores it.
* **Tileable** in both directions: the right edge must join the left, the top
  the bottom. `tools/textures/build.py --check` does not verify tileability
  (that is an art check), but the texture painters wrap all of their noise.
* **Wall orientation**: the image's top row is at the top of the wall and its
  left edge is on the viewer's left from the side the face looks into, so
  signs/borders read correctly on both sides of a partition. A tile is
  `tile_metres` tall; the phase is anchored to the wall top.
* **Floor/ceiling orientation**: image `x` maps to world `+X` and image `y`
  maps to world `+Z`, so an image authored map-style reads with north (`-Z`) up.
* **Colour space**: no gamma handling. The historical sheets were authored pale
  because the material tint and the baked lighting multiply into them; author
  with that in mind or set the tint for your material.

## GLB profile (props and entities)

The `tools/props` writer emits one scene, one node, one mesh, one primitive, one
material and one embedded PNG — and the runtime accepts more than that when a
model comes from elsewhere:

* **Scene graph**: nodes may carry TRS or matrix transforms, composed down the
  hierarchy, and may reference meshes. One model may hold several meshes and
  several primitives per mesh.
* **Materials**: one per primitive, each with an optional
  `pbrMetallicRoughness.baseColorTexture` and `baseColorFactor`. A material with
  no texture draws its factor through the shared white sheet.
* **Emission**: `emissiveFactor`, `emissiveTexture`, and
  `KHR_materials_emissive_strength` (the only accepted extension).
* **Images**: embedded PNG bufferViews only, decoded once per distinct image.
* Attributes: `POSITION` (required), `TEXCOORD_0` (required), `COLOR_0`
  (optional), indices 8/16/32-bit inside the 65 535-vertex cap, `mode: 4`.
* **Rejected** with an actionable message: skins, animations, morph targets,
  sparse accessors, external/data-URI textures, non-triangle modes, and any
  other extension.

A model above the shipped art budget still loads (with a one-time warning)
unless it crosses the engine ceiling, in which case the prop falls back to its
placeholder box exactly as before.

Props keep their textures embedded in the GLB: only level surfaces, decal
sheets and fixture faces load external PNGs.

## Adding a future asset

1. Add the catalog entry (id, class, theme when it belongs to one, type, size,
   colour, category, solid, `model` — or `texture` for a material).
2. For a generated asset (the diagnostic decal atlas pattern), implement or
   extend the renderer's generator and add the id there too; the
   catalog/renderer consistency test will catch a mismatch.
3. For a textured surface, add the PNG and the two catalog entries above; no
   Rust code is involved. A decal sheet or a fixture face is the same two
   entries plus the `tools/textures/` painter when the artwork is ours.
4. For a modeled asset, add a build function to `tools/props/parts/*.py` and
   register it in that module's `PROPS` dict (see `parts/utility.py` for the
   commented exemplar).
5. `python3 tools/props/build.py --only core:your_prop` — this enforces the
   scale/origin/UV/budget rules and writes the GLB at its catalog path.
6. `python3 tools/props/preview.py --only core:your_prop` and look at
   `target/prop-previews/your_prop.png` before trusting it.
7. `python3 tools/assets/validate.py`, `python3 tools/textures/build.py
   --check`, `cargo test` and `cd level-editor && npm test`.

Nothing here is required at runtime: the game loads ordinary packaged GLBs and
PNGs.

## Errors you may see

| message | meaning | fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{id}: material texture `{tex}` is not declared in the asset catalog` | a material points at a texture id that does not exist | add the texture entry or correct the id || `{id}: a material must declare the logical `texture` it draws with` | a material entry has no `texture` | add one (or make it a `generated` asset of another type) |
| `{id}: a texture asset must name a `.png` file, found `...`` | texture `model` is not a PNG | convert the file and update the path |
| `[materials] {level}: material `{id}` texture `{tex}`: cannot read ...` | the PNG is missing at load time | restore the file; the surface shows the magenta/black diagnostic pattern meanwhile |
| `[materials] {level}: unknown material `{id}`; add it to the asset catalog ...` | a level names a material the catalog does not declare | add it (or fix the typo); the surface shows the diagnostic pattern |
| `[materials] {level}: material `{id}` texture `{tex}`: `...png`: PNG decode error ...` | the PNG is truncated or corrupt | re-save it; see the loading tests for the accepted encodings |
| `[decals] decal `{id}`: {problem}` | an external decal sheet's catalog entry or PNG is broken | fix the entry/path; the decal draws the diagnostic sheet meanwhile |
| `{id}: a file-backed light fixture must name a `.png` sheet, found ...` | a light entry points at something that is not a PNG | point `model` at the fixture's artwork |
| `[fixtures] fixture `{id}` sheet `{path}`: {problem}` | a fixture's PNG is missing or corrupt | restore the file; the fixture draws the untextured white sheet meanwhile |
| `[textures] ...` (from `tools/textures/build.py --check`) | file missing, corrupt, oversized or non-PNG | restore the file; `python3 tools/textures/build.py` regenerates 128x128 artwork, so for an upgraded 1024x1024 sheet prefer restoring it from the repository rather than regenerating (the painter skips a differing sheet unless `--force` is passed) |

Validation fails loudly in tooling and degrades visibly in game: a broken
texture is never hidden behind unrelated artwork.

## Development fixtures and checks

`assets/levels/` carries the one level the game ships, `places_demo.json`;
`assets/levels/README.md` indexes it and explains where the regression fixtures
went. The engine fixtures used by the test suite live in
`tests/fixtures/levels/` and are never packaged. The short version:

* `assets/levels/places_demo.json` — **the official demo and the only shipped
  level**, and the level to show someone. One continuous route: office →
  doorways and windows → red stair hall → empty pool → steps up → quiet
  corridor → the unmade world. Run it with `LIMINAL_LEVEL=places_demo`.
* `tests/fixtures/levels/prop_showcase.json` — every placeable asset placed
  once, arranged as a domestic room plus a utility room, including one crate
  deliberately sunk into the floor and a box overlapping it.
* `tests/fixtures/levels/prop_stress.json` — ~150 repeated placements across
  nine models, used to prove that instances share one decoded model, one
  texture and one draw call per model.
* `tests/fixtures/levels/vertical_diagnostic.json` — the vertical-geometry
  fixture: an elevated room reached by a region staircase, a walkable recess
  and a blocked deep recess, a gable room with eave/ridge fixtures, RGB-lit
  corners and decals. Run it with `LIMINAL_LEVEL=vertical_diagnostic`.
* `tests/fixtures/levels/pool_showcase.json` — the Pool family fixture: a real
  recessed empty basin (`floor_regions`), the walk-in step, the ladder standing
  on the basin floor, the patio table and chair, modular curtains and guardrails
  (with collision), both Pool light fixtures and the external `NO DIVING` sign.
  Run it with `LIMINAL_LEVEL=pool_showcase`.
* `tests/fixtures/levels/rendering_diagnostic.json`,
  `tests/fixtures/levels/lighting_isolation.json`,
  `tests/fixtures/levels/lighting_diagnostic.json` and
  `tests/fixtures/levels/test_room.json` — the decal-sheet, wall-boundary
  lighting, lighting-boundary and minimal-room fixtures the renderer and loader
  tests load by name.

The prop fixtures are generated: run `python3 tools/levels/build_fixture_levels.py`
to rebuild them.

Checks to run before shipping an asset change:

```sh
python3 tools/assets/validate.py             # catalog, resources and shipped levels
python3 tools/textures/build.py --check      # surface PNGs and their budgets
python3 tools/props/build.py --check         # files exist, parse and fit the budgets
python3 tools/props/build.py --thumbs        # refresh the editor's prop thumbnails
cargo test                                   # catalog, scale, origin, UV and batching tests
cd level-editor && npm test                  # editor parses the proxies and draws real geometry
```

Useful developer-only run flags (they never affect normal play):

* `LIMINAL_LEVEL=places_demo` — boot straight into a level without entering
  the menu.
* `LIMINAL_CAPTURE=frame.png` — render one frame and write it out, then exit;
  this is how prop rendering is inspected on hardware without a screenshot tool.
* `LIMINAL_SPAWN=x,z,yaw_degrees` (or `x,y,z,yaw`) — stand at a specific spot,
  e.g. in front of a prop that needs a close look.
* `LIMINAL_STATE_LOG=file.csv` — append `frame,x,y,z,yaw,pitch` every few frames
  so movement and control checks can assert real results from a running build.
