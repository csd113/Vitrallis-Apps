# Office environment

The initial office collection: the classic liminal materials, the fluorescent
ceiling fixture and clearly office-oriented furniture.

Every surface material is a **data definition** that names an external PNG
texture. The material owns the tiling/tint; the texture owns the
image file, so a PNG can be replaced without touching the catalog, and the
catalog entry can move without touching a level.

| material | type | texture | PNG |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `core:wallpaper_yellow_01` | material (wall) | `core:tex_wallpaper_yellow_01` | `textures/walls/wallpaper_yellow_01.png` |
| `core:wallpaper_stained_01` | material (wall, damaged) | `core:tex_wallpaper_stained_01` | `textures/walls/wallpaper_stained_01.png` |

| `core:carpet_damp_01` | material (floor, damaged) | `core:tex_carpet_damp_01` | `textures/floors/carpet_damp_01.png` |
| `core:ceiling_panel_01` | material (ceiling) | `core:tex_ceiling_panel_01` | `textures/ceilings/ceiling_panel_01.png` |

| `core:desk`, `core:chair`, `core:cabinet`, `core:water_cooler`, `core:vending_machine` | prop | embedded in each GLB | `props/models/*.glb` |

## Surface artwork

The six PNGs are the shipped Office artwork, not the 128x128 painter output.
They ship as 1024x1024 8-bit RGB sheets, opaque, and tileable in both
directions (the wrapped edges are gated by `tools/textures/seam_repair.py
--check`; see [Texture seam repair](#texture-seam-repair) below). They stay
pale and near-neutral, because the material `tint` and the baked lighting
multiply into the sampled texel; the carpet is the deliberate exception (its
material has no tint), so it is painted at the historical warm-brown albedo.

* `wallpaper_yellow_01` — pale-printed stock: fine vertical striation, a
  pinstripe pair and a half-drop dot motif on a 25 cm cell, plus a low-frequency
  patina. Repetitive and commercial rather than ornate.
* `wallpaper_stained_01` — the same paper with restrained water damage: soft
  damp fields and a few vertical runs. No dark outlines, so the damage does not
  turn into a repeating pattern.
* `carpet_beige_01` — short-pile carpet: low-frequency mottle, fine directional
  fibre and 2 px pile loops. **There is no metre checker anywhere**: the sheet
  is painted so the demo's office carpet keeps its brightness and warmth.
* `carpet_damp_01` — the same pile, darker, cooler and slightly flattened in
  soft damp patches.
* `ceiling_panel_01` — a 2x2 grid of 1 m suspended acoustic panels (2 px T-bar
  plus a 1 px shadow groove), slightly yellowed, with per-panel tone variation
  and pinhole speckle.
* `ceiling_stained_01` — the same grid with a believable water tide mark on one
  panel and a smaller leak on another, clipped by a grid fade so the T-bar
  still reads through the damage.

`tools/textures/office_art.py` carries deterministic, stdlib-only 128x128
painters; the shipped 1024x1024 PNGs are the authoritative artwork and
hand-painted replacements are equally valid.
`tools/textures/build.py --check` gates the budget without writing a file.

The official demo `../../levels/places_demo.json` exercises the set: a warm
office reception and workroom on the yellow wallpaper and panel ceiling, the
stained/damp variants in the areas the building has given up on, sparse desks
and task chairs, cabinets, a water cooler and floor decals.

Generic props (couch, bed, plants, utilities, ...) are deliberately **not**
listed here: they belong to no theme and live under `../../core/`.

## Texture seam repair

The 1024x1024 sheets are the authoritative artwork; the 128x128 generators in
`tools/textures/office_art.py` are the original painters. The
unstained yellow paper, the panel ceiling and its stained variant already
wrapped cleanly; the stained wallpaper and both carpets carried a real
wrapped-edge step on both axes and were repaired via

```sh
python3 tools/textures/seam_repair.py --repair <path-to-sheet.png>
```

`tools/textures/seam_repair.py` is the reproducible source of truth for that
repair: it keeps the colour type, the exact dimensions and the ancillary
chunks, and documents the tuned cross-fade band and roll offset for each sheet
in its docstring. `--report` prints, per axis and channel, the wrapped edge
step against the sheet's own interior adjacent-pixel step; `--check` gates
every sheet on

    mean(wrap) <= 1.60 * mean(interior) + 1.0
    p95(wrap)  <= 2.20 * p95(interior)  + 3.0

for both the raw and the three-tap-smoothed profiles, and exits non-zero on a
failure.

These six sheets ship at 1024x1024 while the painters in `office_art.py`
produce 128x128 output. `python3 tools/textures/build.py` therefore **skips**
them — it refuses to overwrite a sheet whose shipped dimensions differ from its
painter's output — so a plain run cannot replace the artwork; `--force` is
what would replace a sheet with the 128x128 painter output. `python3
tools/textures/build.py --check` only validates the shipped files and never
writes.
