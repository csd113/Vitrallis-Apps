"""Convenience wrapper: (re)generate the spooner-man prop asset.

The real work lives in the pack's toolkit (`tools/props/`), so this script is a
thin, deterministic entry point with the exact command the prop is documented
with:

    python3 tools/generate_spooner_man.py

It builds `assets/props/models/spooner-man.glb` from the low-poly cat module
(`tools/props/parts/spooner_man.py`), refreshes the derived editor proxy file
and thumbnails, and prints the asset's budget report. Blender is deliberately
not part of this: the pack has a Blender-free generator, and nothing here
becomes a runtime dependency.

To regenerate *every* prop instead:

    python3 tools/props/build.py --thumbs
