# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-20

### Added

- Add a static baked lighting system for the level's interiors (`src/lighting.rs`). It runs once per level load and folds a single brightness value per vertex into the geometry the renderer already draws, so there is no dynamic light, no light map, no extra draw call and no shader change on the PocketCHIP target.
- Bake a **room baseline** from floor area, the ceiling fixtures the room owns (count × fixture intensity) and the ceiling height: a 12 m² room with two panels is bright, a 100 m² room with two panels is clearly dim, and the same fixtures count for more under a 2.6 m corridor ceiling than under a 5 m one. Brightness uses a smooth saturating curve, so rooms are never classified into hard tiers and never exceed the valid colour range.
- Bake **local fixture pools**: each panel adds a broad, smooth pool of light measured to its 1.2 × 0.6 m rectangular footprint, so a floor, wall or prop directly under a fixture is brighter than one far from every fixture.
- Bake **doorway blending**: rooms joined by walk-through openings mix a bounded fraction of each other's baseline near the opening (6 m radius, fading above the door header), so a doorway no longer shows a hard brightness step between rooms. Adjacent rooms are never propagated recursively.
- Keep a **minimum ambient** illumination so an unlit room stays visibly dim but navigable rather than pitch black.
- Tessellate floors, ceilings and wall faces on a bounded lighting grid (2.5 m cells, capped per surface) so the baked pools vary across large surfaces without geometry scaling with room area.
- Receive environmental lighting on **props**: every instance's transformed vertices are sampled in world space and multiplied into their existing vertex colours, so a plant standing on a crate or `spooner-man` on the bed is lit at its true height. Repeated instances still collapse into one batch and one draw call per model.
- Add the optional ceiling-light **intensity** property. `brightness` is the canonical field the editor already wrote; `intensity` is accepted as an alias when loading, and both default to `1.0` when omitted. Fixtures now hang just below their own room's ceiling and glow slightly more or less with their output.
- Add deterministic lighting tests (`src/lighting.rs`) covering density, area, intensity, height, saturation, minimum ambient, numerical safety and malformed input, plus renderer tests proving floors, walls and props are baked, vertically offset props sample their true position, batching is unchanged, and an unlit room stays inside the valid colour range.
- Extend the Asset Demo test with lighting assertions: all twelve fixtures are owned exactly once, every room has a navigable baseline, the corridor reads brighter than the rooms it connects, a fixture casts a visible pool, the two sides of a doorway meet without a seam, and every baked vertex colour is finite and in range.
- Add the same static lighting model to the level editor's 3D preview (`level-editor/js/lighting.js`), so authors see a room's relative brightness while editing; the preview approximates local pools (the game remains authoritative). The inspector now documents the intensity scale and warns above the game's clamp.

### Changed

- Room floors and ceilings are now generated on the lighting grid (one quad per bounded cell) instead of one quad per room, and wall faces are split along their length. Levels grow accordingly but stay small and static: `level_1` 9.3k → 61k vertices, the Asset Demo 0.9k → 2.3k, with a 7-13 ms level build in a release build (still one static upload and no per-frame cost). Small rooms stay a single quad and the geometry budget stays bounded.
- The optional fixture intensity and the level's stained wallpaper / damp carpet tints now multiply together, so material variation survives the lighting instead of being washed out.

### Fixed

- Ceiling-light fixtures are placed at their own room's ceiling height instead of a hard-coded 3.49 m, so the corridor of the Asset Demo (2.6 m) no longer draws its panels above the ceiling.

### Notes

- `tools/levels/build_demo_levels.py` now emits ceiling lights through a helper that can declare an intensity. `levels/asset_demo.json` deliberately keeps all twelve fixtures at the default so it also proves that levels without the field behave as `1.0`; `assets/levels/prop_showcase.json` mixes `0.8` and `1.4` fixtures to exercise the field.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-20

### Added

- Add `levels/asset_demo.json`, a walkable demo map that shows off the whole asset pack: four rooms around a corridor, with every catalogue prop placed at least once (all twenty core props plus `spooner-man`, 52 placements in total) and the complete level vocabulary in one level — doorways, a wide passage, three windows, a vent and twelve ceiling lights.
- Exercise the placement features the prop system already supports in that map: several props standing on other props, and `spooner-man` placed on the bed and in the corridor, all with ordinary `y` offsets and rotations.
- Show the material variants Level 1 does not use by defaulting the demo map to the stained wallpaper and damp carpet textures.
- Add `loader::tests::test_asset_demo_level_loads_and_shows_every_asset`, which discovers the map through the normal custom-level path, loads and validates it, asserts every catalogue asset and every opening kind appears, and asserts the level builds real prop geometry with no placeholder boxes.

### Changed

- `tools/levels/build_demo_levels.py` now also generates the demo map (`levels/asset_demo.json`) alongside the two development fixtures, so the map is reproducible rather than hand-edited.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-20

- Match Spooner Man’s reference coat: black back, narrow nose blaze, broad black chin patch, and a single right hind-leg white ring connected to the belly.
- Correct the lathe UV seam and map facial features continuously instead of repeating them across cap triangles; retain the existing 880-triangle mesh and 256x256 texture budget.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-20

### Added

- Add `spooner-man`: a low-poly tuxedo cat prop (880 triangles, one 256x256 texture, one material) placed through the ordinary prop system, with position, rotation, scale and vertical offset behaving exactly like every other prop.
- Add the cat's generator module `tools/props/parts/spooner_man.py` plus the convenience wrapper `tools/generate_spooner_man.py`, so `python3 tools/generate_spooner_man.py` rebuilds the GLB, the editor proxy entry and the prop-browser thumbnail.
- Extend the asset toolkit with two primitives the cat needs: `lathe` (an explicit-ring surface of revolution with per-region UVs, a separate cap patch and floor-contact shading) and `tube_path` (a tapered tube swept along a curved polyline with parallel-transported frames), plus `Mesh.normalize_origin` for deliberately asymmetric props whose bounding box must still be centred on the placement origin.
- Add the derived editor proxy colours for the cat's parts, so the level editor's 3D preview shows a black cat with white socks instead of a neutral blob.

### Changed

- Run `tools/props/build.py` with `--only <id>` now also refreshes that prop's entry in `assets/props/prop_proxies.json` (entries are merged, never partially rewritten).
- Place `spooner-man` in the `prop_showcase` development level, which now covers every catalogue prop.
- Update the asset validation tests, the editor catalogue mirror and the documentation for a pack of twenty-one props.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-20

### Added

- Ship the core prop pack: all twenty `core:*` catalogue entries (`couch`, `armchair`, `chair`, `table`, `desk`, `bookshelf`, `cabinet`, `bed`, `stove`, `sink`, `fridge`, `washing_machine`, `vending_machine`, `water_cooler`, `crate`, `cardboard_box`, `plant`, `rug`, `lamp`, `tv`) now reference real, self-contained `assets/props/models/*.glb` assets instead of placeholder boxes.
- Add `tools/props/` (pure-Python, no Blender): a primitive mesh builder, a procedural texture painter, a minimal GLB writer/reader, a build/validate driver and a software preview renderer, so the whole pack is reproducible with `python3 tools/props/build.py`.
- Add runtime GLB support for props: `src/gltf.rs` parses the narrow self-contained asset profile the toolkit emits, and `src/props.rs` caches each decoded model (mesh, indices, texture) once per catalogue path, complaining once per broken asset instead of retrying.
- Add batched prop rendering: placed instances are transformed once at level load into one shared vertex buffer per distinct model, so ten chairs still cost one draw call, one texture bind and one decoded texture.
- Add automated asset validation: `python3 tools/props/build.py --check` for the files and a Rust test that walks the catalogue and fails with actionable messages on missing models, oversized textures, triangle overruns, wrong scale, off-origin models, non-finite vertices, invalid indices or out-of-range UVs.
- Add the derived `assets/props/prop_proxies.json` (generated from the shipped GLBs) so the level editor previews every prop from its real geometry instead of a hand-maintained duplicate, plus 64x64 prop-browser thumbnails in `level-editor/assets/thumbs/`.
- Add the two development fixtures `assets/levels/prop_showcase.json` (all twenty props, including a deliberately sunk crate and an overlapping box) and `assets/levels/prop_stress.json` (about 150 repeated placements across nine models), generated by `tools/levels/build_demo_levels.py`.
- Add developer-only run flags for hardware checks: `LIMINAL_LEVEL=<level id>` boots straight into a level, `LIMINAL_SPAWN=x,z,yaw` stands at a specific spot, and `LIMINAL_CAPTURE=frame.png` renders one frame, writes it out and exits (the only way to inspect real prop rendering on the PocketCHIP over SSH).
- Add `assets/props/README.md` and `tools/props/README.md`, documenting the registry format, coordinate/scale/origin convention, texture and triangle budgets, the material/GLB restrictions and the workflow for adding a future prop.

### Changed

- Extend `props.json` with the model path for every entry; ids, names, categories, sizes, colours and `solid` flags are unchanged, so existing levels and editor data keep working.
- Props without a usable model (unknown catalogue id, missing file or malformed GLB) now fall back to their catalogue-sized placeholder box with a one-time developer message, instead of always drawing a box.
- Prop textures use CLAMP_TO_EDGE with mipmaps and follow the existing `texture_filtering` setting rather than being forced to a single mode.
- Levels without props are unaffected: no prop buffers, textures or draw calls are created, and existing level files load unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fix prop models being reported as unsupported on desktop only: the loader resolves asset paths relative to the catalogue directory (`assets/props/`), matching how levels and the editor address `models/*.glb`.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-20

### Added

- Add a browser level editor in `level-editor/` with a 2D plan view, an interactive realtime 3D preview, and 2D/3D/split view modes that share one level and one selection.
- Add wall openings: doors, windows, passages and vents are rectangular cuts owned by their wall, so a doorway can be placed by clicking or dragging directly on the wall with no manual wall splitting.
- Add a registry-driven prop system with `assets/props/props.json`, placing furniture, appliance and decorative entries with position, rotation, scale, vertical offset and optional player-blocking collision.
- Add a prop browser with search, category filters and colour previews that lists every catalogue entry and keeps working when a prop or the catalogue file is missing.
- Add a realtime 3D preview (`js/viewport3d.js`) that draws floors, ceilings, walls with their openings, door and window reveals, ceiling lights, props and the player spawn, with X-ray walls, auto-hidden ceilings and a focus/reset camera.
- Add conventional 3D controls: right-drag look, WASD/QE flight, wheel dolly, middle-drag pan, click-to-select, drag-to-move and an on-canvas control hint.
- Add a simple/advanced editing mode where the advanced switch reveals exact coordinates, dimensions, elevations, object identifiers, per-face materials and imported textures without changing the level format.
- Add easy door and window placement that derives the owning wall, wall-relative offset, orientation and opening geometry, and previews the opening in both views before the click.
- Add a Play/Test flow that validates the current level, saves the level file with a suggested name and explains the game's import step instead of duplicating the game's renderer.
- Add the `solid` prop flag to player collision and to the geometry budget so blocking props are honoured by the game loader.
- Add node test suites for geometry, level model, editor operations, prop catalogue, camera math, the 3D viewport and a full editor workflow smoke test.

### Changed

- Extend the level format with an optional `openings` array on walls and a top-level `props` array; both are serde-defaulted, so existing levels keep loading unchanged.
- Build wall geometry in the game from solid slices with jamb and header reveals instead of whole-wall quads, and derive collision boxes from the same decomposition so doorways are genuinely walk-through and window sills still block.
- Reorganise the editor around build → place → preview → play/test → save: one tool rail, tool options for the active tool only, and a contextual inspector that shows the selected object instead of every property at once.
- Replace the separate floor, ceiling and column tools with the room and wall tools, and move uncommon controls such as floor patches and imported textures behind the advanced switch.
- Move the inspector's layer, texture and room lists into collapsible advanced sections and drop the duplicated zoom buttons, compass rose, coordinate labels and always-on height badges.
- Report validation problems in plain language such as "Door opening extends beyond this wall" and keep rejecting only malformed or unsafe data, never intentional overlap, clipping or props sunk into the floor.
- Record undo/redo entries once per completed action, including an entire drag or a click placement, and keep object ids stable across history snapshots.
- Preserve a wall's chosen material by serializing it through the level format's per-face material map instead of dropping it on export.
- Keep openings inside their wall when a wall is resized, and move openings together with their wall.
- Document the editor architecture, controls, wall-opening format and prop catalogue in `level-editor/README.md`.
- Refresh the shipped sample level to demonstrate a doorway, a window and two placed props, including one deliberately sunk below the floor.

### Fixed

- Fix undo and redo restoring the wrong state, which made the first undo a no-op and could drop the action that was being redone.
- Fix placing a light, prop or player spawn by clicking not being recorded in the undo history.
- Fix wall material choices being silently discarded on save because only per-face materials were serialized.
- Fix 3D picking of rotated props using the opposite rotation direction from the drawn box at angles that are not multiples of ninety degrees.
- Fix a 3D drag only applying its first movement step instead of accumulating the whole drag.
- Fix shrinking a wall leaving its openings outside the wall, which produced a validation error instead of clamping them.
- Fix level packs failing to load or export by loading the bundled JSZip script the editor depends on.
